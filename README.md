# Small framework

intro:

1. Faster server app router nodejs without router framework
2. Using lightweight popular KNEX ORM for sql migrations lifecycle : up, down, rollback, and transaction
3. Implement simple handlers and middleware
4. Native cookies injection
5. Implement in memory cache
6. Implement native throttle request
7. Implement request validators

Native first. Anythings should be small and faster.
